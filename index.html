        <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                DOOM (2016) is a fast-paced first-person shooter developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks.
                Made as a reboot to the original DOOM franchise since the release of DOOM 3,
                The franchise makes a return and makes it a grand and bloody one at that.
                It brings back the fast-paced experience of the original DOOM games and increases it by ten-fold, by adding many different levels,
                guns and even a new level of verticality never seen before in previous DOOM games.

                DOOM (2016) received critical acclaim for its gameplay, graphics, and absolute near perfection of a soundtrack composed by the legendary Mick Gordon. IGN gave it a 9.0/10, calling it
                "fast, punchy, and genuinely fun to play." GameSpot praised its "relentless pacing and ultra-violent combat."
